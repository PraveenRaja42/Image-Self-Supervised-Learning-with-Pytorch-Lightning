# Image-Self-Supervised-Learning-with-Pytorch-Lightning


This Code implements Image Self-supervised learning trained on Imagenette dataset, a smaller version of ImageNet. With Data Augmentation Technique we are going to augment the given data, train a network to classify which augmentation technique(rotation or flipping) has been used for a particular image and then apply Transfer Learning on the task we actually want to solve.
