# Image-Self-Supervised-Learning-with-Pytorch-Lightning


This Code implements Self-supervised learning for Image classification on a smaller version of ImageNet called imagenette. With Data Augmentation Technique we are going to augment the given data, train a network to classify which augmentation technique(rotation or flipping) has been used for a particular image and then apply Transfer Learning on the task we actually want to solve.
